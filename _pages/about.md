Systems and control theory. Modelling, analysis and design of dynamical systems. Currently working on data-driven control methodologies with appplications to power systems. 

Brief Bio
------
I am pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the *Algorithms, Optimization and Controls Lab* at the University of British Columbia supervised by [Dr. Dominic Liao-McPherson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=llSJCuUAAAAJ) and [Dr. Alberto Padoan](https://www.albertopadoan.com). 

Prior to this, I completed an MSc in Mechanical Engineering supervised by [Dr. Craig Johansen](https://ucalgary.ca/aerocore/people) at the University of Calgary. Aerospace and Compressible Flow Research (AERO-CORE) Group. My research focused on the implementation of novel control systems for hybrid rockets. Specifically, I developed a novel model for simulation ofsecondary fluid injection thrust vector control for hybrid rockets. [thesis](https://ucalgary.scholaris.ca/items/6b56203e-2e9a-47d3-9770-1729dd6bb196).

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Mechatronics, and received over 20 awards and scholarships, including the Governor General’s Medals and the Seymour Schulich Scholarship. During undergrad, I helped lead the successful launch of three student-designed and manufactured rockets.
