Systems and control theory. Modelling, analysis and design of dynamical systems. Currently working on data-driven control methodologies with applications to power systems. 

Brief Bio
------
I am pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the [Algorithms, Optimization and Controls Lab](https://aocl.mech.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia supervised by [Dr. Dominic Liao-McPherson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=llSJCuUAAAAJ) and [Dr. Alberto Padoan](https://www.albertopadoan.com). My research interests lie at the intersection of control, optimization, and complex engineering systems. 

I previously completed an MSc in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Calgary under the supervision of [Dr. Craig Johansen](https://ucalgary.ca/aerocore/people) in the [Aerospace and Compressible Flow Research (AERO-CORE) Group](https://ucalgary.ca/aerocore/aerocore). My master's research focused on hybrid rocket propulsion, where I developed a semi-empirical model for secondary fluid injection thrust vector control (see my [thesis](https://ucalgary.scholaris.ca/items/6b56203e-2e9a-47d3-9770-1729dd6bb196)).

I completed a BSc in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Mechatronics, and received over 20 awards and scholarships, including two [Governor General’s Medals](https://www.gg.ca/en/honours/governor-generals-awards/governor-generals-academic-medal) and the Seymour Schulich Scholarship. During my undergraduate studies, I helped lead the successful launch of three student-designed and manufactured rockets. 

Across my research and teaching activities, I enjoy communicating complex ideas clearly and creatively and bridging theory with real-world systems. Thanks for checking out my website - I'm always happy to discuss my research or related projects.
