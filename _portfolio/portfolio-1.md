In collaboration with [Dr. Joanna Wong](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/joanna-wong) and the [Laboratory of Engineering Materials](https://www.ucalgary.ca/labs/engineering-materials) at the Schulich School of Engineering, our capstone group successfully designed, manufactured, and implemented a 3D printhead for composite materials, the CFP-500. The CFP-500 (Composite Filament Printer 500) was mounted on a 6-axis robotic arm, instead of a conventional 3-axis gantry system enabling the deposition of the custom filament in configurations that dramatically enhance component strength. The custom tapered nozzle enabled the reinforcement of internal ribbing and other inserts with carbon fiber filament for high performance automotive and aerospace applications. The printhead features a ceramic blade capable of isolating filament paths as short as 10.5 mm, enabling greater design flexibility. Furthermore, the hardened tool steel nozzle is capable of printing at temperatures of up to 500°C. Download our final report [here](files/Capstone_Poster_V7.pdf).
